    <p>Explain, in simple terms, what a process is, how they relate to
 applications, how some are 'system processes', and what you can do with a
 process.</p>
  </comment>

  <p>A <gui>process</gui> is a program or application being executed by the
 system. When an application is launched, the system assigns a unique process ID
 (PID), and its instructions and data are loaded into memory.</p>

  <p>The <gui>Processes</gui> tab displays information on processes, and allows
 you to <gui>Stop</gui>, <gui>Continue</gui>, <gui>Kill</gui>, or change the
 priority of a process. If you choose to display <gui>All Processes</gui>, the
 process list will include <em>system processes</em>, which run in the
 background providing various services that keep a computer running.</p>
