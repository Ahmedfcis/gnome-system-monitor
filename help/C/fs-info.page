  <title>Learn what the File System information means</title>
  
  <!-- ================================= -->
  
      <p><gui>Device</gui> lists the name that the operating system has assigned to the disk. Every bit of computer hardware that is attached to the computer is given an entry in the <file>/dev</file> directory that is used to identify it. For hard disks, it will usually look something like <file>/dev/sda</file>.</p>
  
    <p><gui>Directory</gui> tells you where the disk or partition is <em>mounted</em>. Mounting is the technical term for making a disk or partition available for use. A disk can be physically connected to the computer, but unless it is also mounted, the files on it cannot be accessed. When a disk is mounted, it will be linked to a folder that you can then go to in order to access the files on the disk. For example, if the <gui>Directory</gui> is listed as <file>/media/disk</file>, you can access the files by going to the <file>/media/disk</file> folder on your computer.</p>

    <p><gui>Type</gui> tells you the type of <em>filesystem</em> that is used on the disk or partition. The filesystem specifies how the computer should store files on the disk; some operating systems can only understand some types, and not others.</p>
    
    <!-- ================================= -->
  
  
  
  

  <p>For each device listed in the <gui>File System</gui> tab, <app>System Monitor</app> provides information in a number of categories. </p>

<table shade="rows">
  <tr>
	<td><p>Device</p></td>
	<td><p>This column lists the system-assigned interface directory for a given device or partition.</p></td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td><p>Directory</p></td>
	<td><p>This column contains the user-accessible location, or <em>path</em> where each device is <em>mounted</em> in the filesystem.</p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td><p>Type</p></td>
	<td><p>The filesystem type of a device refers to the way the data is stored on it. For example, <cmd>ext3</cmd> filesystems are common for Home directories, while <cmd>fat32</cmd> is often seen in removable USB drives. </p>
	</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td><p>Total</p></td>
	<td><p>This column lists the total capacity for each device.</p>
	</td>
   </tr>

  <tr>
	<td><p>Free</p></td>
	<td><p>This column lists the space that is free for each device.</p></td>
   </tr>

  <tr>
	<td><p>Available</p></td>
	<td><p>The available disk space can be used by the system and installed programs.</p></td>
   </tr>

  <tr>
	<td><p>Used</p></td>
	<td><p>This column displays both the amount of disk space used and the percentage of available space this represents. </p></td>
   </tr>

</table>

<note><p><gui>Available</gui> space may be less than <gui>Free</gui> space. The extra space holds data necessary for currently running processes.</p></note>
