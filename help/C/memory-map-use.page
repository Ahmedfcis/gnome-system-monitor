  <p>To display the <link xref="memory-map-what">memory map</link> of a
  process:</p>

  <steps>
    <item><p>Click the <gui>Processes</gui> tab.</p></item>
    <item><p>Right click the desired process in the <gui>process list</gui>.</p></item>
    <item><p>Click <gui>Memory Maps</gui>.</p></item>

      <p>The program itself and each of the shared libraries has three entries
      each, one for the read-execute text segment, one for the read-write data
      segment and one for a read-only data segment. Both data segments need to
      be paged out at swap time.</p>
