    <p>Explain what swap is and how it helps. Explain that the computer may run
 slowly if it's swapping too much.</p>

  <p>Swap memory or <gui>swap space</gui> is the on-disk component of the virtual
 memory system. It is pre-configured as a <gui>swap partition</gui> or a
 <gui>swap file</gui> when Linux is first installed, but can also be added
 later.</p>

 <note><p>Disk access is <em>very</em> slow compared to memory access. The
 system runs more slowly if there is excessive swapping, or <gui>thrashing</gui>,
 when the system is unable to find enough free memory. In this situation the only
 solution is to add more RAM.</p></note>

  <p>To see whether swapping,
 or <gui>paging</gui>, has become a performance issue:</p>

  <steps>
    <item><p>Click the <gui>Resources</gui> tab.</p></item>
    <item><p>The <gui>Memory and Swap History</gui> graph shows memory and swap
 use as percentages.</p></item>
  </steps>
