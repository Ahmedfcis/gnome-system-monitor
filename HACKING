Coding style
============

The current codebase is not really consistent about coding
style. However, for new code we should conform to what seems to be the
most common habits:

  * Use four-space indents.

  * Put open curly braces on the same line of the associated
    statement. Omit braces if *both* sides of the statement are on one
    line. So for instance

        if (foo = 0) {
            bar ();
            baz ();
        } else {
            qux ();
        }

    and

        if (foo = 0)
            bar ();
        else
            qux ();

  * Put one space between the function name and the open parenthesis, so

        foo ();

    and not

        foo();
