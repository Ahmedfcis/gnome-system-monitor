I want procman to remain beautiful. The initial
inspiration for the interface comes from the OS-X
process viewer. 

I would rather procman have fewer, more complete 
features, rather than a million half completed features.
I would like to complete a nice finished 1.0 version
that just works and then newer stuff can be pushed in
a development version. Read the TODO for what I think
should go in the initial version
