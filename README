Procman is a nicer, simpler, easier to use replacement
to gtop. It uses libgtop for the process monitoring
and e-table for the viewing.

The CVS HEAD branch is for porting to the GNOME 2.0 platform.
It will be quite unstable for the time being. If you
are looking for the stable branch check out the
procman-1-0 branch from CVS.
