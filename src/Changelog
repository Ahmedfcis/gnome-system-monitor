	*prettytable.c (pretty_table_load_path): don't segfault if the
	directory doesn't exist

2001-07-04 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	*proctable.c(remove_children_from_tree): new function to
	remove all child info if a parent process is removed.

	*proctable.c (remove_info_from_tree): new function to remove
	a process.

	*interface.c (create_main_window): change gtk_wdiget_show to
	gtk_widget_show_all to fix a bug where the infoview state was
	not persistent

	*memmaps.c (get_memmaps_list): add e_tree_memory_freeze and thaw
	to inprove table updating. Add glibtop_free to fix a major
	memory leak.

	*memmaps.c (create_memmaps_dialog): change timeout to be 5 sec. This
	should probably not be hard coded.

	*procman.c (main): remove the push visual and colormap since
	I don't know what use they are for.

	*procman.h, proctable.c: change ETreePath *path to ETreePath path
	since they should not be declared as pointers.

	*proctable.c (proctable_new): make tree default to being expanded.

	*memmaps.[c,h]: create and handle the memmaps dialog. Lots
	of code stolen from gtop

	*callback.s (cb_table_selected): call update memmaps function

	*infoview.c (memmaps_button_click): open the dialog

	*procman.c (procman_data_new, procman_get_save_files): add config
	file for the memmaps e-tree

	*procman.h: added memmaps config file name to config structure

	*proctable.c (update_all): call update memmaps function

	*proctable.c: changed e-tree spec to "single" selection mode so
	only one row can be selected

	*infoview.c (infoview_update): don't duplicate strings for entry
	widgets. This leaks memory.

2001-06-30 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	*proctable.c (insert_info_to_tree): check to see if parent has
	same name. If so assume the child is a thread and don't expand
	the row.

	*proctable.c: renamed get_parent_node to get_parent and return
	parent info in order to check the name

	* some other code cleanups

2001-06-30 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	*interface.c (update_sensitivity): more movement of code
	to interface.c.

	*callbacks.c (cb_table_slected): use update_sensitivity. Move 
	cb_update_selected_row into cb_table_selected.
	
	*proctable.c: remove some unused variables, fix up %cpu.

2001-06-30 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* callbacks.c (cb_double_click): hook up to double click.
	Now toggles infoview

	* interface.c (toggle_infoview): toggles infoview. Beginning of 
	pulling stuff out of callbacks.c to access gtk widgets as global
	variables.
