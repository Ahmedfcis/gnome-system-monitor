-- 1.2 porting stuff --
[x] right click menu
[x] make search work
[x] make sorting work for non strings
[ ] make disk table update
[x] renice doesn't seem to renice
[x] root access stuff
[x] save and restore tree state
[ ] add the extra columns not shown by default
[x] memaps dialog needs porting to tree view
[x] hidden processes dialog needs to be able to select multi strings 
[x/2] make all dialogs proper ie. use gtk_dialog etc.
[ ] disk sizing is not right - 500 kb instead of 500 MB
[ ] removing a node from the tree should remove all children
[x] many strings are untranslated
[ ] merge all changes from stable branch
[ ] many memory leaks

-- 1.2 new features --
[ ] Should be able to drag a process to "end process" button and
    "more info" button and do the appropriate action
[ ] color rows depending on cpu usage 

-- later --
[ ] Perhaps a custom view like show only processes using above 10 MB etc
    but perhaps it's a feature overkill (it's a process viewer after all
    - it should probably remain simple)
