-- Things for 1.0 --

[x] Get %cpu done right
[x] Icons for processes
      A preliminary patch to do this by reading in all 
      the .desktop files has been done by Erik Johnsson <zaphod@linux.nu>.
[x] Get the more info interface done along with updating the values 
    	correctly - This is not quite acceptable. Perhaps doing the items
	as a e-table will help. Done - I like the look now using all
	labels.
[x/2 ] Throw in a few more column displays such as nice, process state.
    But do not show them by default. It is easy to add them with e-table.
[x] Maybe a cpu meter on top?
[x] right click menu - send some signals - at least kill
[x] save the e-table state
[x] remove the process meter on the bottom ( or make it the cpu meter ?)
[x] dialog notifying the user the end process button will not save
    any data ( of course with the "show dialog next time" option )
[x] need to create spec file in order to build packages. I don't
    know anything about packages for other distros than RedHat.
    Neither do I know anything about RedHat packages at the moment.
[x] need a .desktop entry
[ ] need an icon :) I have no skills at doing this.
    Perhaps we can just steal the one that Ximian uses right now for gtop
[x] process tree - almost done except for bug in that children don't show
    up - Done!
[x] put some system info in the status bar like %cpu %mem %swapped
[x] memmaps dialog
[x] menu stuff
[ ] make sure everything is navigatable by keyboard and we have
    accelerators
[ ] Fix bugs of course.
[x] Add the ability to have favorite processes. This would involve a lot
    of things like storing the names in a config file and designing
    a favorites editor. I think this could be pretty neat.
    Done. Instead of doing favorites I did a blacklist where you can
    select processes which you don't care about.
[x] simple dialog when user chooses to hide a process explaining the
    idea just like the end process dialog.
[x] clean up renice dialog. Provide error messages when renice don't
    work.
[x] If user click on hidden process in edit menu give a dialog if there
    are no hidden processes.
[x] simple dialog if search failed
[x] somehow display command arguments. The UI is tricky. Perhaps do this
    as a tooltip to the command argument in the info viewer - hmm I kinda
    like that.
[x] Provide a new function to end a process and call that instead of 
    duplicating code. I think we should send SIGKILL instead of SIGTERM.
[ ] custimization of colors for the graph (including background)
[ ] split settings dialog into notebooks -"Process Listing" "System Monitor"
    "Advanced"
[ ] graphs need to be beautified
[x] swap needs to get into graph (I guess the Mem graph)
[x] need to update the disk usage on a periodic basis
[ ] don't hard code the update intervals. Put the in the config
    file, but don't necessarily make them visible in the UI. Geeks
    should expect to go mucking around into config files to change
    things. That's what makes a geek in the first place.
[ ] Make the renice dialog have options like "important" "very important"
    instead of the nice value (maybe still give the option somehow to
    manually set the nice value).
[ ] hook up renice to su stuff

-- Later --
[x] I'm thinking of maybe doing a graphical system monitor
    thingamabob like memory usage, cpu usage, disk space. This would be
    a separate tab or just a seperate screen. The View: menu could
    become a View as: like nautilus.
[x] How about delay loading the icons to improve startup time? Also
    be smart about reading the .desktop files. If the user wants to
    get back the icons while procman has started, then read the files
    rather than doing nothing and requiring a restart. I think these
    two would go hand in hand. 
[ ] Should be able to drag a process to "end process" button and 
    "more info" button and do the appropriate action
[ ] Should be able to select multiple processes and kill em etc.
